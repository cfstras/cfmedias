As these docs contain some revelations and concepts of mine, they have a seperate license.

You are allowed to distribute them along with the rest of the source code.

You are, however, _not_ allowed to sell any concepts I developed here.

Also, you must not use or distribute these ideas without clearly indicating that I
([cfstras](https://github.com/cfstras/)) developed them.
